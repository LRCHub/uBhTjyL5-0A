Two drunk kids turning up
for the night
Hey, where you been all my life?
Two drunk kids,
are you down for the ride?
And if you're not, I'm waiting
Two drunk kids turning up
for the night
Hey, where you been all my life?
Two drunk kids,
are you down for the ride?
Pace maker,
we're not for the faint
of heart
Let me dance till I die,
till I fall apart
Run around in the night,
it'll hide the scars
Call a cab for me,
take a dab for me
What's one too many drinks
at the club gonna do?
When your whole life is a zoo
What's one too many drinks
at the club gonna do?
Was-was dealing with a punk
by the bouncer
That's when
I caught her staring,
seeing what I'm wearing
Eyes met, silver screen scene,
what a dream
But I doubt she remembers
who I am, but I mean
I know there's physical things
Attraction, her lips, my lips
Need action, come closer
Won't you come closer?

Hey, where you been all my life?

(Hm)
I thought that I would rather
be here all alone
Thought my distractions
were enough to feed my soul
But this girl,
she found the way into my being
Can't fight the feeling now,
she's all I'm seeing
Said her name was T with
a smile and a laugh,
and I smiled back
Grabbed her by the waist,
and she said, "I like that"
Find a better place,
get to know me better
So now we at the spot and we
not turning down
Said she told her friends
that she won't be around
I like the sound of that
Now where were we at
Two drunk kids turning up
for the night
(T-t-two two two, dru- dru-)
Two drunk kids,
are you down for the ride?
(Are you down? A-a-are,
are you down?)
Two drunk kids turning up

Hey, where you been all my life?
Two drunk kids,
are you down for the ride?
(Alright,
so... You gonna tell me
what happened or I'm just
gonna guess?)
Um yea I mean I guess
After that
(Aha)
Yea we just went to her house
(Okay)
It was a really good night
We played games
(Okay)
She ordered food
I met her cat
(Yes)
Uh we had sex, I guess
(Ah yes)
Which is nice
It was good
(Okay)
I like her
(Ho ho)
She's really cute, very funny
(Okay, I bet)
Um, and... and she thinks
I should meet her parents
(That's for you...)
Nononononono, I don't,
I don't know, I don't know
(Yeah)
I think I wanna see her again
(You should)
I think really wanna see
her againn
(You should, you really should,
why not?)
Uh I dunno
Anyways, that's about it
(Yes, sounds like a good time)
